# InfoVis_Dashboard

The goal of the final exercise is to choose the appropriate technique for a small data analysis example of your choice.

You can extend your data analysis by looking into additional aspects using more elaborate visualization techniques. But you do not need to restrict yourself to the provided data. If there is other data you would like to analyze, take this opportunity to do so!

You should provide the analysis in the format of an interactive web site. The project should be thought of as a comprehensive dashboard rather than a portfolio of disassociated visualizations. 

The results of the analysis are presented by the groups at the end of the semester. As usual, we give out the best assignment award after this presentation!
